- How to use this tool
This is a demo machine learning tool to predict the high risk pregnancy in pregnant woment based on their ANC data. So when ANM gives her ANC services and feeds the data we can run this tool to predict the chance of high risk in coming future.
So here we need to pass 'Weeks of pregnancy', 'Age', 'HB Level', 'BP Systolic' and 'BP Diastolic' and then hit 'Submit' button. This will run the algorithm and will show the result with some suggestions.

- Disclaimer
No real data is used in this tool for prediction. So you need to push the real data if you want to use it for any meaningful purpose.
